Document Title: Sovereign Directive 250
Date: July 25, 2025
Classification: QUARTER-MILLENNIUM MOBILIZATION MEMO

Summary:
This document outlines the long-term operating principles behind the Pennsylvania Sovereignty Campaign, beginning on the historical 250-year mark of American civilization’s operational narrative.

Key Tenets:
1. Initiate Post-Bureaucratic Acceleration Zones. Not anarchy, but rather renewed appreciation for self agency.  

2. Repatriate Capital Flows from Federal Drain. 
>A moratorium on all state to federal outflows regardless of source, while refocusing 100% of bandwidth to federal to state inflows. Leverage geography and access to key financial sectors. 

3. Monetize Civic Participation. 
>Governance as Asset Class. (Link to donation page will be live shortly). 

4. Redefine Regulatory Friction Coefficient (RFC). 
>Near limitless opportunity in which the edge of that limit will be tested. 

5. Activate Cultural Export Pipelines. 
>Optimize in state cultural and economic systems that align with civic harmony while opening up new opportunities for our adjacent partners to become stronger. 

6. Tariffs, intentionality deployed with deep understanding of the relevancy and urgency of the TACO Principle, = “Tariffs Accelerate Capacity Ownership.”

For the swift establishment of the credibility and deterrence on retaliation doctrine, Ohio’s tariff just got 10% bigger. 

To read this is to acknowledge you are actively participating in our movement to transform our state’s/ abundances or raw commodity and bloated inefficiency into reclaimed sovereignty.
